        own house and have raised 3 children in it. For most of his working
        life, he has specialized in process improvement. Here is his message to
        voters:

      <p>
        I’m seeking a seat on the WBCSD School Board this November because, like
        you ,I want quality education for all kids in our district.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been watching year after year, our school district asking for and
        getting more money in the form of levy’s, yet enrollment is down, and
        test scores are low.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you asking the same questions as I am? What are we getting for our
        money? Are our kids getting the best education for the money we are
        spending? I find it troubling nothing changes year after year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want nothing but the best for our children so I’m using this
        opportunity to put my experience to use and present a fresh perspective
        and new ideas. I’m not connected to the district in any way (other than
        paying taxes). I have no financial interest and none of my relatives
        work for the school district.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m asking for your support to be an advocate for you, the parent and
        taxpayer. As a Board/Trustee Member I will work hard to achieve a higher
        standard of education and to hire and retain the best teaching staff.{" "}
