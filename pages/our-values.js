          <h1>We believe in the following:</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Triune God</strong> - The Father, His only Son Jesus Christ,
            and the Holy Spirit; as described in the Holy Bible is our true sovereign
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Imago Dei</strong> - We are all individually created in God’s
            image, so we soundly reject secular humanism, collectivism, and
            advocates or adherents to the supremacy of one group of people
            over another, such as black nationalists, white supremacists,
            socialists, communists, members of masonic and similar orders,
            practitioners of identity politics, et cetera
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Right to Life</strong> - Individual life is sacred
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Liberty</strong> - Individual liberty is the cornerstone
            of our republic, which we must defend with our lives, our
            fortunes, and our sacred honor
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Individual Rights</strong> - Liberty is upheld via a series
            of just negative rights, in particular (but not limited to): freedom
            of speech, freedom of association, freedom in religion, the
            right to bear arms, the right to acquire and own property,
            and the right to engage in the pursuit of happiness
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>American Exceptionalism</strong> - The United States of
            America was founded on principles endowed by our Creator The
            Constitution - We have been gifted a nation built upon law based
            in The Constitution, which must be interpreted and implemented as
            it was originally intended by the Founding Fathers
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Justice</strong> - The Constitution and Bill of Rights was
            designed to enshrine and protect sacred negative rights to be equally
            administered, free of judicial activism
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Marriage</strong> - The union of one man and one woman is
            the cornerstone of family, community, and nation; thus it is sacrosanct
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Responsibility</strong> - We must accept the full
            mantle of self-governance and accept our own successes and failures
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>State’s Rights</strong> - Our republic consists of a
            confederation of individual States in order to protect against the
            potential tyranny of a federal government, and the authority of a
            centralized federal government should therefore be strictly
            and carefully limited
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fiscal Responsibility</strong> - Government at all levels
            should adhere to the principles of low taxation, maintaining a balanced
            budget, and opposing pork barrel spending so as not to infringe upon the
            liberty of individuals
          </p>
