      <h1>We believe in the following:</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          Triune God - The Father, His only Son Jesus Christ, and the
          Holy Spirit; as described in the Holy Bible is our true sovereign
        </p>
        <p>
          Imago Dei - We are all individually created in God’s image,
          so we soundly reject secular humanism, collectivism, and
          advocates or adherents to the supremacy of one group of people
          over another, such as black nationalists, white supremacists,
          socialists, communists, members of masonic and similar orders,
          practitioners of identity politics, et cetera
        </p>
        <p>
          Right to Life - Individual life is sacred
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberty - Individual liberty is the cornerstone of our republic,
          which we must defend with our lives, our
          fortunes, and our sacred honor
        </p>
        <p>Individual Rights - Liberty is upheld via a series of just
           negative rights, in particular (but not limited to): freedom
            of speech, freedom of association, freedom in religion, the
            right to bear arms, the right to acquire and own property,
            and the right to engage in the pursuit of happiness
        </p>
        <p>
          American Exceptionalism- The United States of America was founded
          on principles endowed by our Creator The Constitution - We have
          been gifted a nation built upon law based in The Constitution,
          which must be interpreted and implemented as it was originally
          intended by the Founding Fathers
        </p>
        <p>
          Justice - The Constitution and Bill of Rights was designed to
          enshrine and protect sacred negative rights to be equally
          administered, free of judicial activism
        </p>
        <p>
          Marriage - The union of one man and one woman is the cornerstone
          of family, community, and nation; thus it is sacrosanct
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Responsibility - We must accept the full mantle of
          self-governance and accept our own successes and failures
        </p>
        <p>
          State’s Rights - Our republic consists of a confederation of
          individual States in order to protect against the potential
          tyranny of a federal government, and the authority of a
          centralized federal government should therefore be strictly
          and carefully limited
        </p>
        <p>
          Fiscal Responsibility - Government at all levels should adhere
          to the principles of low taxation, maintaining a balanced budget,
          and opposing pork barrel spending so as not to infringe upon the
          liberty of individuals
        </p>
