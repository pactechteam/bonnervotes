**WHY?**

**Why, do we need a 4.7 million dollar Levy?**

**Why, 3 million of it is just for extra salaries?**

**Why do we have 20+ more teachers than what the state provides funding for?**

**Why do we need an audit before we let a levy pass?**

The district has put a Levy on the Ballot to collect from property owners \$4.7
million per year for 2 yrs. **Why is there such a large increase** to the last
levy amount of \$3.4 million? In prior years the property tax portion of the
revenue has been listed at 25% of the Budget**, this levy will increase the
local taxpayer’s portion to 33% of the budget. Why?** When everyone else in the
community has to tighten their own belts, why should the school district be any
different?

According to the district **\$3 million of this is going just for salaries**.
The business office was aware that the Governor intended to increase all wages
around 16% for the State. **Why, was this subsidy not calculated into the
formula, in order to reduce the amount of what is needed for the Levy? Why do
they always hold the kids HOSTAGE** when the real reason they run a levy is for
their own pocket books.

**The state only reimburses the schools for 62 teachers yet the district retains
over 82 certified Staff.** Why does this district continue to make the local
taxpayers foot the bill for their in ability to better manage their staffing
needs? On top of this they want to keep all the Esser3 funded Counselors and
aids that were hired with Federal money this year. Why should the local tax
payers be required to continue to fund these salaries if the Feds won’t?

Several of our representatives on this board have been asking for a deep look
into the current budget so they could get a better idea on how much was really
needed for the levy, **but every time they make the request**, the business
office has ignored them. The business office is not giving them access to the
necessary information to make an informed decision but instead is it appears to
be directing their attention away from what they are requesting. Then is
claiming a deadline of May 28th to get the approved budget to the state, without
knowing if the Levy is going to pass or not.

Every Audit since 2017 clearly states: **There is not enough separation of
duties** in the district business office to meet **generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP)** standards. The chairman of the board signs off every year,
that the **board is aware and accepts the risk** for this non-compliance. By
policy the Superintended is ‘responsible for developing internal controls
designed to detect fraud, financial impropriety or fiscal irregularities within
the district.” **Yet the former Superintendent (P.A.) did not follow the
policy** that has been in place since Dec, 2013. **Why?**

**There are many irregularities found in the financial reports from prior
years** resulting in questions on the bookkeeping practices of the previous
business manager, but when records requests are turned in to clear up those
questions, requests are stonewalled with incomplete information, or require
large fees to get access, it begs the question **why the information is being
guarded from public view.**

Right now there are **28 properties on the County Treasures desk** in which the
county is in the process of seizing the homes of families who can’t come up with
the money to pay their taxes. We are told that 60% of kids in this district live
in poverty? How does this correlate with the taxpayers of this district? How
many more will be on the Treasures desk if this levy gets passed?

**This is why a 3rd party audit is necessary!** As well as to ascertain if the
funds received from previous levies have been spent the way the voters approved
when those levies were passed. These are just a few of the questions that
require answers before we allow this levy to pass. Before we strap the community
with this excessive \$4.7 million levy, **we NEED an Audit.**

**Please “Vote No” on the WBCSD Levy, Tuesday May 16th**
